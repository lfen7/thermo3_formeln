# Formulae for the second part of Thermodynamics III at ETH

Here you'll find the formulae we are supposed to know by heart for the exam. They are taken mostly from the exercise slides.

I do not guarantee neither correctness nor completeness. If you find something is missing or incorrect, please send me an email to lfent@ethz.ch.
